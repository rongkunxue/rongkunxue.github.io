I am a first-year graduate student from the [School of Automation Science and Engineering](http://automation.xjtu.edu.cn), [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn). My research interests include diffusion generative models, optimal transport, offline reinforcement learning, and imitation learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jing Yang](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/yangjing) at the [School of Automation Science and Engineering](http://automation.xjtu.edu.cn), XJTU University.Currently, I am conducting research internships at the Decision Intelligence Lab, [Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn).
